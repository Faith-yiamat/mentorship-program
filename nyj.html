    <pre><b>Some issues arising in chapter one and two are religion and education.</b>

<h2><b> Religion </b></h2>
   As a devoted Christian,Noah's mother believes that the more churches she attends,
   the more blessings she will receive and the greaterthe likelihood that her prayers
   will be heard. She brings her family to three different churches every Sunday. 
   In  Addition, Noah talks about a time when his mother scolded him for imitating 
   a TV character, which made him doubt the Christian forgiveness doctrine. 
   This is evident in Narok County where people believe that churches are different
   and they believe in receiving blessings when they visit every church. Children 
   are also taught about the word of God and they are punished when they disobey 
   what they are taught.

<h2><b>Education</b></h2>
  Noah and his mother can see the bigger picture, envision the better life they want to 
  lead and focus on pursuing and increasing their prospects of landing a job.Patricia 
  instills in Noah the value of critical thinking from a young age, which is even more 
  significant than formal education. To ensure that "he will know that the ghetto is not
  the world,"Patricia "spoke to [Noah] like an adult," taught him English, gave him 
  books—especially fantasy, which expands his imagination—and took him to "places black 
  people never went." Similarly in Narok County where people believe that through education 
  they will be able to get jobs and lead a good life. Parents provide their children with
  books to read to improve their studies.
